#Simulation - learning scala the fun way
I'm using this game simulation to teach myself to code in scala.
Check it out (figuratively or literally) if you're new to scala and 
you may find something interesting to you. 
I'm trying to code idiomatically, but i'm not quite there yet.  


The simulation is based on an IOS game that I've wasted too much time playing (thanks, Kevin).
So I thought I'd teach the computer to play the game and see if it can get a 
higher score than I do because it will make fewer mistakes than I make.

The game is kind of a reverse-tetris.  Where three pieces are provided and then
you have to choose which piece to play where - and in which order.  The goal is
to continually clear lines based on piece placement so that as you get more pieces
you can continue to play (that's the tetris-like capability)

FYI - when i compile this with scalac, I get gc or out of memory errors when it runs.
Compiling with sbt works, so whatever - i'll learn it later.  If you know why, please tell me
(A friend suggested changing the heap size as in: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1441373/increase-jvm-heap-size-for-scala - I'll look into that)

Yeah: both java and scala are new to me :)

Stats:
* right now my top score is just over 2,000
* top score goal:  >10,000 
* long term goal:  >1,000,000

Also - feel free to contribute. 

Enjoy
